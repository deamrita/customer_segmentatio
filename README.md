# customer_segmentation
Customer segmentation of a supermarket using k means clustering
K-means Clustering:
Unsupervised machine learning algorithm

Assumptions:
1.	The data should be symmetrical.
2.	The mean of the variables should be equal.
3.	The variance of the variables should be equal.

Key steps
1.	Data pre-processing
2.	Choosing a number of clusters (elbow method)
3.	Running k-means clustering on pre-processed data
4.	Analyzing the findings
